      <h1>About Ada</h1>
      <p class="lead">Changing the face of the Seattle Tech industry. Tuition-free developer training + paid internship.</p>
      <p><a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> (Ada), a fiscally sponsored project of <a href="https://www.tsne.org/" target="_blank">TSNE MissionWorks</a>, is an intensive developer training program for women and gender diverse people with little software development experience.</p>
      <p>In one year, students are taught programming techniques and best practices to enable them to become junior developers. The program consists of two distinct parts, six months in the classroom, and five months of internship at local sponsor companies, where students refine their skills working on real-world code.</p>

    <section class="container">
      <h1>Admissions Process</h1>
      <p class="lead">Ada is more than a coding boot camp, so we accept students who want more than a coding education.</p>
      <p>Through our admissions process, we are looking for applicants who demonstrate the following qualities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Investment in social justice, diversity, and inclusion</li>
        <li>Passion for software development</li>
        <li>Aptitude for learning</li>
        <li>Grit</li>
        <li>Composure under stress</li>
        <li>Ability to work well with others</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ada's admissions process consists of four parts. Submitting the initial application (instructions are on this page) is the first part. Following that there is a coding challenge, a technical interview about that challenge, and finally an in-person panel interview. All parts after the initial application submission are by invitation only.</p>
      <p>For more details on Ada's Target Student and Admissions Process, please check out <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/applicants" target="_blank">our main Admissions Page</a>.</p>

            Technical Challenge
          </h3>
          <p>For the technical challenge you will need to explore and analyze a large data set which is provided by Ada. There are five questions to answer, which increase in difficulty and ambiguity. While getting the correct answer is possible for most questions, our reviewers assess your answers based on your explanation of your process and any logical deductions or assumptions you made during your analysis.</p>
          <p>For all questions we ask that you keep your explanation concise (under 700 words per question) as our reviewers have a large number of applications to process.</p>
          <p><strong>Detailed instructions, along with the questions are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XiXI-ynpyeuSUauqTgs72nOLtTxtYK3nk_p3CWo3AHY" target="_blank">available here</a>.</strong></p>
